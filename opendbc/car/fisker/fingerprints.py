# CAN fingerprint — every non-diagnostic address the Fisker Ocean broadcasts on ADASBUS
# (Bus.pt = 0) with the car in Run mode. openpilot's can_fingerprint uses an EXCLUSIVE
# match (see opendbc.car.fingerprints.is_valid_for_fingerprint): the candidate is kept
# only if every observed CAN address < 0x800 is present in this dict with a matching DLC,
# so a minimal "distinctive-only" fingerprint doesn't work — the FULL bus contents are
# required.
#
# Note: this fingerprint reflects one trim/firmware. If a different trim adds or removes
# any address, the exclusive match fails — extend the address set or switch to FW-based
# identification if that becomes an issue.

# UDS FW-version fingerprints. We do not actually query FW versions on the Ocean —
# FW_QUERY_CONFIG.requests is empty, so no UDS traffic is generated at runtime — but
# match_fw_to_car_exact eliminates a brand candidate by walking its ECU list and
# failing when a live FW doesn't match; with a truly empty ECU dict, the walk is
# skipped and fisker becomes a "matches everything" false-positive against other
# brands' fingerprints (see test_exact_match). This placeholder essential ECU at a
# fisker-unique address ensures the exact matcher can reject fisker for non-Ocean
# live FW versions. Replace with the real EPS FW string once one is captured on
# vehicle; the address 0x7A5 is not queried by any brand today.
